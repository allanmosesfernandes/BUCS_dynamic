<h2>Sustainability at NTSU</h2>

<h2>Sustainability is more than just a word. There's a sustainability dimension to everything we do (as individuals and
    as an organisation).</h2>

<p><strong>At its core, sustainability refers to the societal goal for people and nature to safely coexist on earth for
        as long as possible.</strong></p>

<p>The United Nations have developed a set of <u><a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">17 Sustainable Development
            Goals</a></u> to help guide sustainable practices worldwide. <u><a
            href="https://www.trentstudents.org/about-us/our-mission">NTSU's 2025 Strategy</a></u> holds our sustainable
    progress accountable according to these goals.</p>

<p>This section of our website shows what NTSU is doing to meet its sustainability objectives and provides information
    on what you can do as an individual to lower your carbo footprint and live a more sustainable lifestyle. Use the
