Remedying this can be complicated, but in general, tenants should take steps such as:
<ul>
    <li>keeping the bathroom door shut during and after a bath or shower</li>
    
    <li>keeping large items away from walls</li>
    
    <li>avoiding drying clothes in a room with no ventilation</li>
    
    <li>closing the kitchen door and opening a window or using an extractor fan when cooking</li>
    
    <li>covering pans when boiling</li>
    
    <li>maintaining low constant heating and increasing it as and when required</li>
    
    <li>ensuring the landlord is aware of any heating problems that could allow damp or condensation to linger</li>
</ul>
