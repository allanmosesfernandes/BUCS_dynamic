<h1>General accommodation advice</h1>

<h2>We know accommodation can be a major source of stress for students.</h2>

<p>From choosing who to live with, where to live, and when to choosing your accommodation to dealing with contracts,
    landlords, and legal issues, there’s a lot to get your head around. Large sums of (often non-refundable) money are
    at stake, and you have to live (literally) with whatever decisions you make for a whole year.</p>

<p>We’ve put together this FAQs page to help you make informed decisions at every stage of your housing journey. Read it
    carefully and bookmark it for future reference.</p>

<p>If you need help with anything regarding your accommodation, book an appointment with our advice team. They are
    trained to deal with accommodation issues and will be happy to help you with yours.</p>

<h3>FAQs</h3>

<p><strong>When should I start looking for next year’s accommodation?</strong></p>

<p>This is completely up to you and your future flatmates, but here are some things you should know:</p>

<p>· Housing for the next academic year tends to be released on the market in November of the current academic year—nine
    months before you’ll move in.</p>

<p>· A lot can happen in nine months, and your circumstances, your flatmates’, or your relationship with them can change
    considerably in that time. This means that there are risks associated with choosing your flatmates and accommodation
    early.</p>

<p>· However, there are also risks to delaying your decision. People you were hoping to live with may commit to living
    with someone else, and you may find your preferred accommodation is no longer available by the time you make your
    choice. You must weigh up the risks of rushing and those of waiting and come to a decision that it right for you.
</p>

<p>· The number of student rooms available in Nottingham is larger than the number of students. In theory, that means
    there is no rush to choose next year’s accommodation.</p>

<p>· The most popular accommodation tends to be taken first, however. So, if you desire a specific area or accommodation
    building, the sooner you will need to act to avoid disappointment.</p>

<p>· NTSU runs a housing fair in our City Campus building each November. This features vetted and approved accommodation
    providers who we consider to be reliable, safe</p>

<p>options offering fair value for money. We may be biased, but we think attending the fair is the best way to find your
    accommodation for next year.<br />

<h3>Who should I live with?</h3>

<p>The people you live with have a huge impact on your university experience. The more people you live with, the greater
    the chance of interpersonal conflict. Your best bet is to live with people who you get along with and can trust.
    Choose friends from your present house or accommodation, your course, or your SU club/ society. If you’re stuck for
    housemates, use facilities such as NTU’s Message Board where you can place an advert to find fellow students.<br />
    &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What types of accommodation can I choose from?</strong></p>

<p>There’s lots of choice, from University halls of residence and private halls to private landlords and lodging. There
    are pros and cons to each type. Do your research and decide which option would suit you most.<br />
    &nbsp;</p>
<h3>
    
    Where should I look for accommodation?
</h3>

<p>If you want to live in university-managed accommodation, look on <a
        href="https://www.ntu.ac.uk/life-at-ntu/accommodation">NTU’s Accommodation webpages.</a></p>

<p>If you want to see a wider selection of student housing, Google “Student accommodation in Nottingham.” The search
    results will give you popular lettings agents as well as specific properties.</p>

<p>If you know how many people you’re living with and the area or type of accommodation you want, you can try a more
    specific search, like “Student house for four in West Bridgford.”</p>

<p>Student accommodation is often listed on sites like Zoopla and right Move, so try searching on there too.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a single room for yourself in shared accommodation, try using the Spareroom app, searching on
    Facebook, or this <a href="https://ntuaccommodation.boardhost.com/">NTU accommodation board</a>. These are all
    places where students list spare rooms in their accommodation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

What do I need to know before viewing accommodation?

<p>First, if you are looking in the Nottingham City area, check the property is accredited through the <a
        href="http://nottinghamcity.gov.uk/NottinghamStandard">Nottingham Standard</a>. The Nottingham Standard helps
    tenants identify properties that meet a minimum quality standard. Checking for this is a reliable way to filter out
    undesirable properties.</p>

<p>Most properties in Nottingham City require a licence, which helps to maintain quality and safety standards in private
    rented sector accommodation.<a href="https://www.nottinghamcity.gov.uk/housinglicensing"> Learn more about
        Nottingham City Council’s schemes here.</a></p>

<p>In other areas (e.g. Rushcliffe), some larger shared properties may require a House of Multiple Occupation (HMO)
    licence. Check with the local council if you’re in another area. NTSU has partnered with <a
        href="https://www.marksoutoftenancy.com/">Marks Out Of Tenancy</a> (MOOT) so NTSU students can leave reviews
    about their property and landlord/agent. It’s worth checking MOOT for reviews of any properties you’re interested in
    before committing to one.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Viewing properties

<p>Photos or someone else’s descriptions can be misleading. You should always view the property or room you’re thinking
    of moving into to make sure there are no surprises or confusion after the contract is signed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>What type of agreement do most students sign?</h3>

<p>Most students sign joint fixed term <a
        href="https://england.shelter.org.uk/housing_advice/private_renting/assured_shorthold_tenancies_with_private_landlords">assured
        shorthold tenancy agreements</a>. These are the most common form of tenancy for anyone renting privately. A
    joint tenancy means you are renting the whole property as a group and, importantly, the landlord can hold everyone
    jointly responsible for the rent.</p>

<p>A fixed-term tenancy means you will usually be tied to the contract from the date the tenancy starts until the date
    it ends (these dates will be specified in your tenancy agreement). Most students who want to leave before the fixed
    term has ended will have to find a replacement tenant to take over. &nbsp;Until they do, they are legally liable to
    pay the rent until the fixed term ends or a replacement student takes over their agreement.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Can I get my tenancy agreement checked before I sign?</h3>

<p>Tenancy agreements are legally binding documents. Once you sign one, you are bound by its terms and liable for any
    financial obligations detailed within it.</p>

<p>Please read our tenancy agreement guide before signing anything so you understand your agreement’s key terms and
    conditions and your rights and responsibilities as a tenant. This will help you avoid signing something you later
    regret.</p>

<p>Our advice team can help you understand your agreement before you sign it, should you wish. If there is anything you
    are unsure about or want further clarity on, don’t sign your tenancy agreement on the spot. Instead, <a
        href="https://www.trentstudents.org/support-advice/information-advice-service">book an appointment with us.</a>
    Your landlord should allow you 24 hours to take the agreement away and read through it properly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>What money will I be asked to pay?</h3>

<p>Many landlords and estate agents request a <a
        href="https://england.shelter.org.uk/housing_advice/tenancy_deposits/holding_deposits">holding deposit </a>to
    reserve a property. A holding deposit can’t be more than one week’s rent. This may or may not be refundable, so only
    pay a holding deposit if you're serious about taking on the tenancy—otherwise you may lose the money if you change
    your mind.<br />
    If you go ahead with the tenancy, the holding fee will usually form part of your<a
        href="https://england.shelter.org.uk/housing_advice/tenancy_deposits/paying_a_tenancy_deposit"> tenancy (damage)
        deposit</a>. This should be protected in a <a
        href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/housing/renting-privately/during-your-tenancy/check-your-landlord-has-protected-your-deposit/">tenancy
        deposit scheme</a> within 30 days of handing it over. You may also be asked to pay a retainer/half-rent for the
    summer period.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
    
    Will I have to pay tenant fees?
</h3>

<p><strong>All upfront fees for tenants are banned. If you sign a new tenancy or renew your tenancy, you cannot be asked
        to pay for:</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Referencing</li>
    <li>Credit and immigration checks</li>
    <li>Administration</li>
    <li>Renewing your contract</li>
</ul>

<p>The only fees you can be charged are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>For the cost of replacing a lost key</li>
    <li>A penalty if you’re more than 14 days late with your rent</li>
    <li>If you want to change your tenancy or end it early</li>
</ul>

<p>The applies to most private tenants, including if you have an <a
        href="http://The applies to most private tenants, including if you have an assured shorthold tenancy, are in student housing, or if you’re a lodger.  If your landlord tries to charge you any banned tenants fees, report them to Nottingham City Council’s Trading Standards Team">assured
        shorthold tenancy</a>, are in student housing, or if you’re a lodger. &nbsp;If your landlord tries to charge you
    any banned tenants fees, report them to <a

    &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Do I need a guarantor?</h3>

<p>Some landlords and agents ask for a guarantor form to be completed. Your guarantor will become liable for your
    financial obligations if you don’t pay your rent. If you don’t have anyone willing or able to do this, you will need
    to find accommodation where a guarantor is not required.</p>

<p>It is sometimes difficult for international students to provide a guarantor, so please ask your agent or landlord
    about this before signing anything. To help international students with this dilemma, NTSU has got NTU to partner
    with <a href="https://lim.yourguarantor.com/">Yourguarantor </a>to provide a UK-based guarantor for students who
    need one.</p>
