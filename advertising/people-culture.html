    <p><strong>Could you implement and monitor the People &amp; Culture Strategy at Nottingham Trent Students’ Union to
            take
            us to the next level?</strong></p>

    <p><strong>We’re looking for someone who can help put equality, diversity and inclusion at the heart of our
            ambitious,
            supportive and student led organisation.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Who are we?</strong></p>

    <p>Part business, part charity – students’ unions are seriously fun places to work. They are organisations in their
        own
        right. Professional teams support elected student leaders to make change, improve lives and fulfil potential, we
        help make it happen.</p>

    <p>Nottingham Trent Students’ Union (NTSU) is one of more than 550 students’ unions across the country. With more
        than
        40,000 members, 300 student staff and nearly 60 career staff, along with huge range of services across multiple
        campuses we are one of the biggest. We run coffee shops, bars, nightclubs, advice centre, representation,
        student
        groups and much more.</p>

    <p>Professionally run, but different.</p>

    <p><strong>What’s the job?</strong></p>

    <p>We are a forward-thinking organisation that wants to be better. We need you to help develop and deliver a people
        &amp; culture strategy that supports high quality staff development, innovation, and project-based working.</p>

    <p>We are looking for someone who understands that different is good, the more diversity, the better the ideas, the
        greater the impact. We want to make change happen by developing and empowering people and ensuring a sustainable
        approach to our activities.</p>

    <p><strong>Who you are</strong></p>

    <p>We need people who are prepared to make an impact in a different way and are committed to our values. So, we aim
        to
        recruit people who can use their specialist skills, knowledge, and experience to support and empower people to
        do
        and make change for themselves.</p>

    <p>You’ll be a flexible CIPD professional, energised by a vibrant and varied workplace and dedicated to continual
        improvement.</p>

    <p>You’ll be at home with in-person and digital communications, able to deal with the difficult conversations and
        provide colleagues with high quality advice, guidance, systems, and solutions.</p>

    <p>With a commitment to sustainability, you’ll play a key role in supporting our work in this area.</p>

    <p><strong>Why apply?</strong></p>

    <p>Because you want to work in an energetic, dynamic, and innovative workplace. The exact opposite of corporate,
        we’re
        progressive, creative individuals working to make a difference in unconventional workplaces. In return for your
        passion and experience we offer the flexibility for work-life balance, and a competitive salary for the
        non-profit
        sector.</p>

    <p>We’re absolutely open to considering requests for job-share or part-time working. We’re committed to equality of
        opportunity for all. We welcome applications from individuals regardless of their race, ethnicity, sexual
        orientation, religion, age, gender, or disability status. We want to create a diverse and inclusive work
        environment
        and are actively looking for people who share our values.</p>

    <p>Whoever you are, if you’re a CIPD professional looking for something a bit out of the ordinary, we’d love to hear
        from you.&nbsp;<br />
