<h1>Academic support</h1>

    yourself struggling with a specific problem (e.g., your workload or you feel you've been unfairly treated or
    graded),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.trentstudents.org/support-advice/information-advice-service">speak to our advice
        team</a>, who are independent from the university and can give you straight, honest advice without any conflict
    of interest.</p>
